Python Container Types;
  There are 4 comon types
    * Ordered Sequence- fast index access, repeatable values
          list
          tuple
          
    * Key Containers- no a priori order, fast key access, each key is unique
          dict
          set
Mutability:         
    Not all python objects handle changes the same way. Some objects are mutable,
    meaning they can be altered.Others are immutable; they cannot be changed but 
    rather return new objects when attempting to update.
    
    *The following are some immutable objects:
            int
            float
            decimal
            complex
            bool
            string
            tuple
            range
            frozenset
            bytes
    *The following are some mutable objects:
            list
            dict

Python module Import. and globals() and locals() name spaces and functions.
    The Python code for a module named aname normally resides in a file named aname.py
    You can use any Python source file as a module by executing an import statement in some other Python source file
    *Locating Modules
        When you import a module, the Python interpreter searches for the module in the following sequences âˆ’
            1. The current directory.
            2. If the module isn't found, Python then searches each directory in the shell variable PYTHONPATH.
            3. If all else fails, Python checks the default path. On UNIX, this default path is normally /usr/local/lib/python/.
            4. The module search path is stored in the system module sys as the sys.path variable. The sys.path variable contains the current directory, 
               PYTHONPATH, and the installation-dependent default.
            5. set PYTHONPATH = c:\python20\lib; Sets the python path
            6.Variables are names (identifiers) that map to objects. 
               A namespace is a dictionary of variable names (keys) and their corresponding objects (values).
            7.The globals() and locals() functions can be used to return the names in the global and local namespaces depending 
              on the location from where they are called.

Python PACKAGE and packing/organising your code.
    A package is a hierarchical file directory structure that defines a single Python application environment that 
    consists of modules and subpackages and sub-subpackages, and so on.
    
    Consider a file Pots.py available in Phone directory. This file has following line of source code âˆ’
        def Pots():
            print "I'm Pots Phone"
    Similar way, we have another two files having different functions with the same name as above âˆ’
            Phone/Isdn.py file having function Isdn()
            Phone/G3.py file having function G3()

     Now, create one more file __init__.py in Phone directory âˆ’
     Phone/__init__.py
     
     To make all of your functions available when you've imported Phone, you need to put explicit import statements in __init__.py as follows âˆ’
        from Pots import Pots
        from Isdn import Isdn
        from G3 import G3
        
        After you add these lines to __init__.py, you have all of these classes available when you import the Phone package.
        # Now import your Phone Package.
        import Phone

            Phone.Pots()
            Phone.Isdn()
            Phone.G3()
            When the above code is executed, it produces the following result âˆ’
            
           * Output;
            I'm Pots Phone
            I'm 3G Phone
            I'm ISDN Phone

Python file Reading.
          1. Access Mode:The access_mode determines the mode in which the file has to be opened, i.e., read, write, append, etc. 
             A complete list of possible values is given below in the table. This is optional parameter and the default file 
             access mode is read (r).
          2. buffering âˆ’ 
             If the buffering value is set to 0, no buffering takes place. If the buffering value is 1, line buffering is performed
             while accessing a file. If you specify the buffering value as an integer greater than 1, then buffering action is 
             performed with the indicated buffer size. If negative, the buffer size is the system default(default behavior).
             
             #This is better for common text file. If you have csv or some seperated data file. Better use pandas;
             
                r	:	Opens a file for reading only. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. This is the default mode.
                rb	:	Opens a file for reading only in binary format. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. This is the default mode.
                r+	:	Opens a file for both reading and writing. The file pointer placed at the beginning of the file.
                rb+	:	Opens a file for both reading and writing in binary format. The file pointer placed at the beginning of the file.
                w	:	Opens a file for writing only. Overwrites the file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for writing.
                wb	:	Opens a file for writing only in binary format. Overwrites the file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for writing.
                w+	:	Opens a file for both writing and reading. Overwrites the existing file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for reading and writing.
                wb+	:	Opens a file for both writing and reading in binary format. Overwrites the existing file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, creates a new file for reading and writing.
                a	:	Opens a file for appending. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. That is, the file is in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for writing.
                ab	:	Opens a file for appending in binary format. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. That is, the file is in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for writing.
                a+	:	Opens a file for both appending and reading. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. The file opens in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for reading and writing.
                ab+	:	Opens a file for both appending and reading in binary format. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. The file opens in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for reading and writing.
